      "HAS CHINA really blown `$6.8` trillion on [worthless investments](http://wallstreetcn.com/node/211297) over the past five years? This is the startling claim made by two Chinese government researchers that has, understandably, [caused quite](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/20/china-economy-investment-idUSL3N0TA2KP20141120) [a stir](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/002a1978-7629-11e4-9761-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=intl#axzz3KJdiuSo5). If true, it would mean that fully 37% of Chinese investment since 2009 was wasted on building bridges to nowhere and homes with no one in them. There is, without question, plenty of worrying evidence that Chinese investment has become less efficient in recent years. But a closer look at how the researchers produced the `$6.8` trillion figure badly damages their claim. Calling it a back-of-the-envelope estimate would be undeserved praise."

      "The `$6.8` trillion calculation was made by Xu Ce of the National Development and Reform Commission, an economic planning agency, and Wang Yuan of the Academy of Macroeconomic Research, a think-tank under the commission. Their analysis was published last week as an [opinion piece](http://money.163.com/14/1120/02/ABF8SCQQ00253B0H.html) in the Shanghai Securities Journal, a government-run newspaper. In their article, they estimate that worthless investment totalled 7.9 trillion yuan in 2009; 5.4 trillion yuan in 2010; 4.7 trillion yuan in 2011; 10.6 trillion yuan in 2012; and 13.2 trillion yuan last year. That amounts to 41.8 trillion yuan over the past five years, or `$6.8` trillion at the current exchange rate."

There are practical difficulties \u2013 for example, we know that some government investment funds have been skimmed off by corrupt officials, but it takes careful forensics to track the ill-gotten gains of one rotten official, let alone thousands of them. Even greater are the theoretical challenges. China has clearly built too many homes, too quickly, but if some of those that stand empty today are eventually bought then what once seemed a wasted investment could yet turn into a productive one."

First, they use the 1979-96 ICOR average of 2.6 as their baseline estimate of what China\u2019s ICOR ought to be were its investments all efficient. Next, they calculate the difference in China\u2019s investment efficiency from 2009-13. For example, in 2009, the ICOR was 5, which is 48% less efficient than the baseline ICOR of 2.6. Therefore, they conclude, 48% of all Chinese investment in 2009 \u2013 7.9 trillion yuan \u2013 was worthless. Similar calculations for each year up until 2013 yields the eye-popping result that 41.8 trillion yuan has been wasted."

      "That leads to the second and even bigger flaw \u2013 namely, this is a lousy method for calculating wasted investment. ICOR serves as a rough guide to the efficiency of investment. It does not, however, show how much money was been wasted, only that it is generating smaller or bigger growth returns compared with previous years. For example, say that an investment of `$1000` boosts GDP by `$500` this year, but only by `$400` next year. In this case, ICOR will have risen from 2 to 2.5. Using Mr Xu and Ms Wang\u2019s framework, because investment is 20% less efficient in the second year than it was in the first year (ICOR of 2.5 vs 2), this is tantamount to 20% of investment, or `$200`, being worthless. But that is completely absurd. All we can conclude is that the return on investment has fallen, not that `$200` has been wasted. Moreover, it is inevitable that in years when investment soars \u2013 which was, after all, the point of China\u2019s stimulus package \u2013 investment returns will appear to suffer. The real question is whether those investments deliver returns over time, hence the point in looking at average ICORs over a longer period."
